                <h3 id="article5">Project Goals</h3>
                <p>The goal for my Game On! project is to expand beyond the rules of PIG and add different variables that make the game more interesting. For example, I plan on including a “light shield” feature that players can obtain if they choose to skip their turn. This adds another dynamic to the game compared to if pass with not many consequences or benefits. This project is different than the other two projects because I have a clearer vision of expanding it beyond the assignment qualifications. This project is similar to other projects in the sense that it shows my personality and interest. Each project of mine tells a bit about myself. This project showcases my interest in the game Valorant.</p>

                <h3 id="article4">Design Strategies</h3>
                <p>My plan for the overall feel of the project is to emulate the visual of Valorant since my project is based on that game. The style will be close to a “cyber and modern” feel. I will be using colors that I color-picked from screenshots of the actual game. The closest typography I found is “Oswald” which is a condensed, narrow typeface giving it a “gamer” look and feel. The buttons and decorative elements will be heavily influenced by in-game design elements. I will display the characters differently than in the game. Valorant is a first-person shooter game, making the design in a first-person view. But since my design is played on one device, I will be displaying both players on one screen.</p>

                <h3 id="article3">Interaction Strategies</h3>
                <p>If I was given the time, I would allow the players to choose their choice of agent. This adds some personalization to the game. I would also set a timer for a minute and 30 seconds (similar to the actual game) to defeat the other players. As for visual feedback, there will be hover interactions such as a change in background color to signify that the element is interactive and clickable. I would also include audio feedback when the player either rolls (gunshot audio) or pass (equips shield) from the actual game.</p>

                <h3 id="article2">Experience Goals</h3>
                <p>I would want users to have a sense of familiarity and uniqueness when playing the game. For other Valorant players, I would want my game to feel familiar by emulating the visual and audio designs of the game. I also want to include features that are in the game such as getting your opponent’s health to zero, buying a shield for protection, etc. But I would also like to add a sense of uniqueness by incorporating elements from the rule of PIG. These elements include rolling on a random number generator and passing to optimize game strategy. I would achieve this goal by incorporating elements from both games in an intuitive, clear way.</p>
