                <p>This was my first concert since the stay-at-home covid regulation so I was super excited to attend concerts again! :D I got into keshi in 2019 right after his tour ;-; the concert sold out while I was in line during the general sale but luckily my friends gifted me tickets for my 21st birthday so lots of love to them ♥ԅ(ˆ⌣ˆԅ)</p>

                <h3>Porter Robinson (DJ Set)</h3>
                <h4>October 30th, 2022<br>The Warfield, San Francisco</h4>
                <p>This was probably the most spontaneous thing I've ever done!! During this time of my life, I was experiencing extreme burnt out and I decided to buy concert tickets two days before the show!! It was about more than an hour drive to San Francisco from Davis but it was worth it in the end (˵◡‿◡⑅) I'm usually a planner so doing things in the moment did make me a bit nervous but I still think about how fun this concert was!

                <h4>January 1st, 2023<br>1015 Folsom, San Francisco</h4>
                <p>Not going to lie, I didnt really know Dabin when attending his concert. I started listening to him after buying tickets and was just there to hangout with friends! 〵(`∀´-)人(ʘ‿ʘ)人(-`∀´)ノ Me and my rooommates did cosplayed as demon slayer hashiras! Even though I didn't know much of the songs, it was still fun dancing with friends through his songs! 10/10 would do it again ┏(‘⌐⦵_⦵’)ノ♬♪</p>
